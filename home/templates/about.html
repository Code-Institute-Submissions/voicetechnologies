                Voice Technologies is an award-winning, employee-owned software provider based in Paisley (near Glasgow)
                and Sheffield in the UK. We help organisations to reduce the time and cost of producing correspondence
                by using information and mobile workflow, speech recognition and digital dictation applications.

                Customer-focus is at the heart of everything we do. We are a trusted partner to our clients in the
                public and private sectors, working closely with them to understand the issues they face and creating
                efficient ways of working that make a positive contribution to their financial and organisational
                efficiency.

                Our team of in-house specialists develops innovative software including the award-winning WinVoicePro, a
                document creation and workflow management application, and FormStream, web-based e-forms for paperless
                documentation.

                We provide products and applications with industry-leading partner companies including Philips, Olympus
