                <h1>WinVoiceWeb is the next evolution in the WinVoice suite of products</h1>
                <h3>Entirely web-based, WinVoiceWeb combines WinVoicePro functionality with a fully refreshed user
                    interface to allow even quicker document production, management and distribution.</h3>
                <h4>Streamlining, simplifying and speeding up document workflow is at the core of WinVoiceWeb</h4>
                <h4>New document creation</h4>
                <p>In WinVoiceWeb, the creation of a new document has never been easier. A simple two step process,
                    simply enter a patient identifier and select a letter template and your document will be created.
                <p>

                <h4>Verification</h4>
                <p>Documents can be created and verified in one step or, alternatively, can be saved for verification
                    at a later date. Documents requiring verification are easily accessible from the home screen of
                    WinVoiceWeb.</p>

                <h4>Document management</h4>
                <p>WinVoiceWeb has all the document management features available in WinVoicePro allowing documents to
                    be routed, printed or flagged as necessary.</p>

                <h4>Remote launch integration</h4>
                <p>WinVoiceWeb can be launched from within third party systems, such as Clinical Portal, allowing the
                    new job process to be launched from within other clinical systems.</p>

                <h4>Development</h4>
                <p>Development is being phased, with all clinician functionality featuring in the first version. All
                    secretarial information will be made available from version 2 onwards.</p>
